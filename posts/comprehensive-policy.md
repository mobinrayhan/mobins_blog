JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const myName = "Rayhan Uddin Mobin";

function getName(name) {
  return name + " is a future Programmer";
}

const mobin = getName(myName); // you can give your name . promise you will be shocked ðŸ¤­
console.log(mobin);
```
